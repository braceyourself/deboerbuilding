            <div>
                Before
                selling
                one home and purchasing another, it is a good idea to consider all of the costs involved. There
                are
                Realtor fees, revenue stamps, title insurance, closing fees, surveys, recording fees,
                appraisals,
                and the list goes on. In most cases, these and other expenses equal around 10% of the price of
                your
                current house. Investing that 10% in an addition is often more beneficial in the long run.
                Please
                give us a call or send us an email to get more information on adding on to your current home and
                making the best decision you can for yourself and your family.
